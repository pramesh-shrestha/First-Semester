/*In a 9-hole Golf tournament, a player had the following number of hits 3, 5, 1, 3, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3.
Create a class with a main method in which you:
a) Create an int array initialized to contain the 9 values shown above
b) Use a loop to calculate the total number of hits for the 9 holes and the number of
Hole-in-Oneâ€™s, i.e. the number of elements being equal to 1. (The loop should not
rely on 9 as being the length of the array, but made more general so that it could be
changed later on)
c) After running the loop print out the following:
1. The total number of hits
2. The average hits per hole (the average value of the 9 elements)
3. The number of Hole-in-Ones
