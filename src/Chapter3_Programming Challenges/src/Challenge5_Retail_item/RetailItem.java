/*5. RetailItem Class
Write a class named RetailItem that holds data about an item in a retail store. The class
should have the following fields:
-description. The description field is a String object that holds a brief description
of the item.
-unitsOnHand. The unitsOnHand field is an int variable that holds the number of units
currently in inventory.
-price. The price field is a double that holds the itemâ€™s retail price.

Write appropriate mutator methods that store values in these fields and accessor methods
that return the values in these fields. Once you have written the class, write a separate
program that creates three RetailItem objects and stores the following data in them.

Description               Units On Hand       Price
Item #1 Jacket                  12            59.95
Item #2 Designer Jeans          40            34.95
Item #3 Shirt                   20            24.95
