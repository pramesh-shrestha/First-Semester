/*Read some integers from keyboard and store them into an array. First, read from keyboard how
many elements you are going to insert (the size of the array).
Print "Contains no 7-9-13" if the array did not contain any elements with value 7, value 9 or value 13.
Otherwise, the program prints "Lucky!"
Example1: {2, -4, 6, 5, 6, -9} –output: "Contains no 7-9-13"
Example2: {2, 7, -9, 4} –output: "Lucky!".*/
