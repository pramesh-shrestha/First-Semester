/*5. BankCharges Class
A bank charges $10 per month plus the following check fees for a commercial checking account:
$.10 for each check if less than 20 checks were written
$.08 for each check if 20 through 39 checks were written
$.06 for each check if 40 through 59 checks were written
$.04 for each check if 60 or more checks were written
The bank also charges an extra $15 if the account balance falls below $400 (before any
check fees are applied). Design a class that stores the ending balance of an account and the
number of checks written. It should also have a method that returns the bankâ€™s service fees
for the month.*/
